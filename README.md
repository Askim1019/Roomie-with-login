# Roomie

Roomie is a responsive-web-app which a group of people can use. Here we made the app for room-mates.
The application can be used after creating a personal id and password. If registered then you can 
access the website.The calender page  shows current month by default and To-dos will be marked in 
the calender. User can click the To-do to the task and the room-mate assigned to finish that task.

Smacktalk is an interactive page so that roommates can leave messages publically so that those who have valid id and password can see those messages. The chores page help users to assign their to-dos.

You can view the site at: https://ss-roomie2018.herokuapp.com/calendar
