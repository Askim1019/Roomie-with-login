# Roomie

Roomie is a create-react-app that is specifically designed for housemates, roommates, bedfellow, flatmate, what have you! 

The application can be used after creating a personal id and password. Once registered, you can access the website that is specific to the house/apartment that you share with your roomies. 

## Page Details: 

Calendar - The calendar page shows the current month with the current date highlighted in light blue. The chores input in the ChoreForm page will show up on the specific dates that they are due. When you click on the task name a modal will pop up showing who the chore has been assigned to and the details of the chore. 
SmackTalk - The SmackTalk page is a interactive page that roomies can gather and comment or smacktalk other roomies but compliments would be ideal, obviously. 
ChoreForm - The ChoreForm page is used to input new chores which will be randomly assigned to the roomies and show up in the Calendar page

## Deployment

You can view the site at: https://ss-roomie2018.herokuapp.com
